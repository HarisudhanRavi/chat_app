# Live Chat Application in Phoenix LiveView

This project is a live chat application built using Phoenix LiveView. It leverages WebSockets for real-time message passing and utilizes Phoenix Presence to track online users.

* Real-time messaging is facilitated using WebSockets underneath Phoenix LiveView.
* User presence tracking is managed by Phoenix Presence, allowing the monitoring and display of online users.

To start your chat server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

The chat app serves on [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000/login)
